#### Using `sed` to extract a patch from a file

While running the [OpenAI Codex CLI] locally, I came across a `sed` command that prints
specific lines from a file. The agent often uses this command to output a portion of a file:

```sh
sed -n '12,15p' <filename>
```

This prints lines 12 through 15 of `<filename>`.

#### [dotGo 2014 - John Graham-Cumming - I came for the easy concurrency I stayed for the easy composition][28]

I had to watch this twice to fully appreciate it. John Graham-Cumming crams a 40-minute talk
into 14 minutes. First, he shows how Go's basic types and stdlib make writing a DNS lookup
program quite trivial. Then he walks through how he generalized it with a simple interface.
The code can be found [here][29].

#### [GopherCon 2019: Socket to me: Where do sockets live in Go? - Gabbi Fisher][27]

Gabbi Fisher shows how to write basic TCP and UDP socket servers in Go. It's pretty easy
since the `net` package in the standard library offers some handy abstractions. Plus, making
the servers concurrent is quite simple because you can easily spin up a new goroutine to
handle each connection.

I've written socket servers in Python before, and making them concurrent wasn't fun—even
with the nice abstractions of the `socketserver` library.

But holy smokes, why is it so hard in Go to customize socket behavior—like enabling
`SO_REUSEADDR` to let multiple servers bind to the same port?. The last 10 minutes of the
talk explores that.

#### [GopherCon 2021: Becoming the metaprogrammer: Real world code generation - Alan Shreve][26]

This is one of the best talks I've seen on Go code generation. Alan Shreve explains what
code generators are and surveys several popular tools, such as stringer, go mock, ffjson,
sqlc, protoc, and babel. He then shows how to write a simple code generator in Go.

One thing I learned is how `go test` works underneath. Instead of running your test
functions directly, `go test` reads your test source code, identifies the tests, and writes
a new piece of source code—a test harness—that calls those test functions. This harness is
then compiled, executed, and discarded. Similarly, when you run `go test -cover`, it
generates a modified copy of your source code with extra statements inserted to track which
parts of your code are executed.

#### [The official ten-year retrospective of NewSQL databases - Andy Pavlo][24]

I still have a hard time explaining the difference between wide-column (column-family)
databases like Cassandra/ScyllaDB and NewSQL databases like Spanner/CockroachDB.

Column-family databases are generally designed as AP systems—they favor _availability_ and
_partition tolerance_ over strong consistency. They let you define a schema upfront but
store rows sparsely, so each row can have different columns. This design is especially
useful in write-heavy environments where sacrificing strict consistency can improve
performance.

In contrast, NewSQL databases are typically CP systems that prioritize _consistency_ and
_partition tolerance_. They provide full SQL support and strong ACID guarantees, ensuring
every transaction remains consistent across distributed nodes. However, under heavy write
loads, if you're willing to relax strong consistency, column-family databases can often
outperform NewSQL systems.

#### [What goes around comes around... and around... - Andy Pavlo (Dijkstra Award 2024)][23]

Andy Pavlo's enthusiasm for databases is infectious. I remember reading the paper mentioned
here sometime last year, and this talk is a great complement to it. Andy explains why SQL
databases work and why RDBMS should be your default choice when building applications. It's
also fun to see database vendors trying to move away from SQL, only to add support for it a
few years later.

While I default to SQLite/Postgres for my applications, I've also been fortunate enough to
work in places where I've seen Postgres fail under massive write loads. As a result, I tend
to steer clear of the overzealous Hacker News crowd that loves to bash NoSQL and NewSQL
databases without considering why they were introduced in the first place.

#### [Rob Pike - what we got right, what we got wrong | GopherConAU 2023][21]

Go definitely got concurrency right. However, I still think that channels, wait groups, and
mutexes are a bit too low-level, and Go missed out on providing some higher-level building
blocks based on these.

Also, it's interesting to see Rob Pike admit that dependency management and generics are
areas where Go could have done better. I still think generics came to the language a tad too
late—but eh, better late than never.

#### [GopherCon UK 2019: Fun with pointers – Daniela Petruzalek][19]

Daniela explains how Go's pointers are much simpler and safer than those in C/C++, while
still providing users the power of indirection. One example surprised me: I was expecting
the following snippet to raise a nil pointer dereference error. However, it doesn't. In the
`StructGoesBoom` method, `m = nil` only modifies the local copy of the pointer to
`MyLittleStruct`. This means the original struct remains unaffected. Running the code
confirms that the struct wasn't modified at all:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

type MyLittleStruct struct {
    something int
}

func (m *MyLittleStruct) StructGoesBoom() {
    fmt.Println("Boom!")

    // This only changes the local copy of pointer m
    m = nil
}

func main() {
    x := MyLittleStruct{1337}
    fmt.Printf("address: %p\n", &x)

    // Desugar x.StructGoesBoom()
    (*MyLittleStruct).StructGoesBoom(&x)
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", x)
}
```

Output:

```txt
address: 0xc0000140a0
Boom!
main.MyLittleStruct{something:1337}
```

#### [The “active enum” pattern – Glyph][18]

Glyph shows a neat pattern for encoding behaviors in a Python enum. Instead of defining an
enum and then handling behaviors in a function like this:

```py
from enum import Enum, auto


class SomeNumber(Enum):
    one = auto()
    two = auto()
    three = auto()


def behavior(number: SomeNumber) -> int:
    match number:
        case SomeNumber.one:
            print("one!")
            return 1
        case SomeNumber.two:
            print("two!")
            return 2
        case SomeNumber.three:
            print("three!")
            return 3
```

A better way to do it is:

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from typing import Callable


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class NumberValue:
    result: int
    effect: Callable[[], None]


class SomeNumber(Enum):
    one = NumberValue(1, lambda: print("one!"))
    two = NumberValue(2, lambda: print("two!"))
    three = NumberValue(3, lambda: print("three!"))

    def behavior(self) -> int:
        self.value.effect()
        return self.value.result
```

An excellent name for the situation where a tool is so complex to use that people simply
copy existing configurations and tweak them until they work for their specific cases.

#### [Ghostty by Mitchell Hashimoto][16]

How do you pronounce Ghostty?

1. Ghos-tty
2. Ghost-ty
3. Something else

Funny name, but an excellent terminal. It's the first emulator to pull me away from the
default macOS/Ubuntu terminal. Since I spend most of my time in VS Code's integrated
terminal, the rough edges of Ghostty don't bother me much. In fact, I'm quite enjoying it.
My config is minimal:

```txt
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"
font-family = "JetBrains Mono"
font-size = 20

# Background configuration
background-opacity = 0.95
background-blur-radius = 20

#### [GopherCon 2015: Embrace the interface – Tomas Senart][15]

One great thing about Go is that you can grok a 10-year-old talk and still find it relevant.
Here, Tomas demonstrates the decorator pattern in idiomatic Go, showing how to add logging,
instrumentation, or retry functionality to an RPC function without polluting its core logic.
The result is a Python-like decorator workflow without syntactic sugar that feels native to
Go.

#### [How I program with LLMs – David Crawshaw][12]

My LLM workflow is pretty similar to David's. Instead of dumping my whole codebase into the
model, I find it way more effective to use the chat UI and tackle a problem piece by piece.
The responses are way better when the problem space is smaller and the model needs less
out-of-band information to work—probably how a human would perform in a similar context.

The _reservoir sampler for the quartiles of floats_ example is a perfect demonstration of
why LLMs are so useful in programming, even with their tendency to make things up or get
stuck in a rut.

#### [Back to basics: why we chose long polling over WebSockets – Nadeesha Cabral][10]

Long polling has its fair share of issues, but in my experience, it's been more reliable
than WebSockets in most cases where I've needed to maintain long-running HTTP connections.
Modern databases can handle a surprising number of connections these days, and adding proper
indexes can mitigate the risk of overwhelming the database with too many open connections.

Sure, Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets exist, but reliably detecting changes in the
backend and delivering them to the right client still feels like an unsolved problem. Until
that's resolved, long polling remains a surprisingly simple and robust solution that just
works. It's already used as the fallback solution in most WebSocket setups.

#### [Be a property owner and not a renter on the internet – Den Delimarsky][8]

I'm loving this renaissance of personal blogs. Den's take on POSSE (Publish Own Site,
Syndicate Elsewhere) really resonates—it's the only viable way to create content without
getting trapped in the walled gardens of billion-dollar megacorps. About five years ago,
Medium burned me, so I followed Simon Willison's advice and started this blog. Easily one of
the best decisions I've made in the past decade.

#### [Stop designing languages. Write libraries instead – Patrick S. Li][2]

When I first started dabbling with Go, I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't have
anything as slick as Python's FastAPI. Generating API docs directly from code required a
flexible type system and robust introspection capabilities, which Go just didn't have back
then. But now, with generics in the mix, libraries are finally emerging that can generate
OpenAPI specs and docs from code without much fuss.

> _The design of the programming language directly determines what sort of libraries you can

#### [Databases in 2024: A year in review – Andy Pavlo][1]

From Redis and Elasticsearch's licensing drama to Databricks vs. Snowflake's billion-dollar
sparring, to DuckDB's integration into Postgres—this post offers a great overview of the
major database events of 2024.

I've been reading Andy's database event reviews for the past three years and love his work.
However, I'm not sure how to feel about the unwarranted shade thrown at Redis. While I don't
agree with Redis Ltd.'s licensing decisions, I still think it's a marvelous engineering
artifact that has shaped the query languages of many similar key-value storage systems.
