#### [Databases in 2024: A Year in Review – Andy Pavlo][1]

From Redis and Elasticsearch's licensing drama to Databricks vs. Snowflake's billion-dollar
sparring, to DuckDB's integration into Postgres—this post offers a great overview of the
major database events of 2024.

I've been reading Andy's database event reviews for the past three years and love his work.
However, I'm not sure how to feel about the unwarranted shade thrown at Redis. While I don't
agree with Redis Ltd.'s licensing decisions, I still think it's a marvelous engineering
artifact that has shaped the query languages of many similar key-value storage systems.
