**[How to Be a Better Reader][3] - NY Times**

> _To read more deeply, to do the kind of reading that stimulates your imagination, the
> single most important thing to do is take your time. You can’t read deeply if you’re
> skimming. As the writer Zadie Smith has said, “When you practice reading, and you work at
> a text, it can only give you what you put into it.”_

> _At a time when most of us read in superficial, bite-size chunks that prize quickness —
> texts, tweets, emails — it can be difficult to retrain your brain to read at an unhurried
> pace, but it is essential. In “Slow Reading in a Hurried Age,” David Mikics writes that
> “slow reading changes your mind the way exercise changes your body: A whole new world will
> open up, you will feel and act differently, because books will be more open and alive to
> you.”_

**[Dark Matter][1] by Blake Crouch**

I just finished the book. It’s an emotional rollercoaster of a story, stemming from a
MacGuffin that enables quantum superposition in the macro world, bringing the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics to life.

While the book starts off with a bang, it becomes a bit more predictable as the story
progresses. I still enjoyed how well the author reified the probable dilemma that having
access to the multiverse might pose. Highly recommened. I’m already beyond excited to read
his next book, [Recursion][2].
