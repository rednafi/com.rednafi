Wisdoms, aphorisms, and pointed observations — fragments I find myself frequently quoting in
conversations about software, philosophy, and ways of working.

### [Chesterton's fence]

Reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is
understood.

### [Gell-Mann amnesia effect]

The Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a cognitive bias describing the tendency of individuals to
critically assess media reports in a domain they are knowledgeable about, yet continue to
trust reporting in other areas despite recognizing similar potential inaccuracies.

### [Gall's law]

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that
worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make
it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

### [Hanlon's razor]

Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

### [Hofstadter's law]

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

### [Hyrum's law (the law of implicit interfaces)]

With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the
contract: all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by somebody.

### [Kernighan's law]

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write
the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

[kernighan's law]: https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law

### [Occam's razor]

Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.

### [Parkinson's law]

Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

### [Ringelmann effect]

It's the tendency of an individual to become increasingly inefficient as more and more
people are involved in a task. In other words, as more individuals are added to a team, the
more the average individual performance decreases.

### [The Beyoncé rule]

If you want to be confident that a system exhibits a particular behavior, the only way to be
sure it will is to write an automated test for it. Google calls it the Beyoncé Rule.
Succinctly, it can be stated as follows: "If you liked it, then you shoulda put a test on
it."

### [The law of conservation of complexity (Tesler's law)]

There is a certain amount of complexity in a system which cannot be reduced.

### [The law of leaky abstractions]

All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.

### [The law of the instrument]

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

### [The law of triviality]

Groups will give far more time and attention to trivial or cosmetic issues rather than
serious and substantial ones.

[the law of triviality]: https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#the-law-of-triviality

### [The principle of least astonishment]

People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations,
and mental models.

[the priciple of least astonishment]:
    https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#the-principle-of-least-astonishment

### [The Unix philosophy]

Software components should be small, and focused on doing one specific thing well. This can
make it easier to build systems by composing together small, simple, well-defined units,
rather than using large, complex, multi-purpose programs.
