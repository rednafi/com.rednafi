## Software

### Tech stack

I prefer lean and stable tools that allow me to build things quickly without much theatrics.

Python, Go, Django, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB are among the subsets of
tools that I really enjoy working with.

For infrastructure, I like to take the least fancy routeâ€”setting up a VPC, configuring Nginx
and SSL with Ansible, and then publishing Dockerized services. But I'm also comfortable
working with GCP or AWS.
