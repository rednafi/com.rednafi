# Submenu Test

This page is for testing the submenu functionality.

If you can see this page, the submenu should be working. Check the navigation menu - there
should be an "etc" menu item with a dropdown arrow that reveals "about" and "2025" when
clicked.

## How to test:

1. Look at the navigation menu
2. Find the "etc" menu item (it should have a small arrow)
3. Click on "etc" to reveal the submenu
4. You should see "about" and "2025" options appear below it
5. Click outside to close the submenu

If this works, the submenu implementation is successful!
