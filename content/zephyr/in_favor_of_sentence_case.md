Up until now, I've always preferred **Title Case** to demarcate titles and section headers
in my writings. However, lately I've realized that each time I start writing a sentence, I
waste a few seconds deciding on the appropriate case of the special words like—technical
terms, trademark names, proper nouns, etc—and how they'll blend in with the multiple
flavors[^1] of rules around title casing. Plus, often time, special casing of selected words
makes title-cased sentences look strange.

This led me to asking a question[^2] on Twitter to find out if anyone had the same thought
as mine or if it'd be ignored as trifling pedantry. A few people responded and they had a
few excellent points on what they liked and disliked about title case. What surprised me
that majority of them preferred **Sentence case** where you'd only capitalize the first
letter of the first word of a sentence and then the capitilization of words would conform to
the usual grammatical rules. So instead of this:

> _Dataclasses in Python Eliminates Class Initialization Boilerplates._

you'd do this:

> _Dataclasses in Python eliminates class initialization boilerplates._

This allows me not to waste those few precious seconds thinking about the rules of upper
casing and whether or not sentences with technical words in them will look awkward. Also, it
saves me from creating horrors like this where the semantics of a sentence get massacred by
the eccentricity of title casing:

_Sentence case everywhere_ is the general trend I'm seeing on the technical blogs of some of
the big players on the internet:

-   [Django docs]
-   [Dropbox blog]
-   [GitHub blog]
-   [Twitter blog]
-   [GitLab blog]

One thing that I'll admit is, at first it just doesn't look right to me for a title to have
sentence casing. Also, I'm not too conviced to adopt sentence case in technical papers.
However, Robert Smallshire argues[^3] that if it works for the Economist[^4], it should work
for most of us.

So, I'm kind of leaning towards sentence casing and have slowly started adopting it in my
writings everywhere. This blog used to conform to a mangled version of title casing to
delineate the titles and sub headers but I've converted all the posts to adopt sentence case
from now on. I'm quite happy with the results so far and it's definitely one less thing to
worry about.
