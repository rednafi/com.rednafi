If you're a manager, then there's no shortage of information on how to conduct exit
interviews. But there aren't many resources that focus on how to handle them from an
employee's perspective. I've been meaning to write a quick piece that isn't biased by
anyone else's experience and is short enough so that I can quickly jog my memory in the
future should the need arise. While I've participated in a few of them over the past five
years, this text does not attempt to combat the inexorable recency bias that may have
seeped into the writing.

Exit interviews are a bit trickier than your typical run of the mill one-on-ones, mostly
because:

* It typically means that you're resigning voluntarily, and not getting fired
* By the time it happens, there's usually no going back
* There are rarely any objectives that benefits you
* The gains are low but the stakes can be high

Instead of throwing a wall of text sectioned by a bunch of headers, I'm intentionally
keeping the list of actionables open ended and a bit aphoristic:

* Avoid it if you can
* Ask for a short one if you can't
* Try to exit early if you can't do either
* The less work your interviewer has put into the meeting, the better
* No point in detailing out why you're leaving, be vague
* It's a mistake to discuss next steps and future opportunities
* You can't change the culture through one last meeting, so don't try to
* Your objective opinions can cause more harm than good
* Last minute feedback matters less than you think, they've heard these before
* A counter offer is usually a bad idea for both parties
* If you sense a trap, silence is your friend
* Let it be awkward
* Don't be a child or throw tantrums
* Be neutral and don't react to tantrums
* Maintain mutual respect for both yourself and your employer
* Remember, it's all business at the end of the day
* And finally, don't burn any bridges
