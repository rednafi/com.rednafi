A lot of the time, I see beginners and junior engineers struggling with the decision of
which language to learn, which framework to pick up, and suffer from an analysis paralysis
that slows down growth. I've seen it over and over again over the years and given the same
advice enough times to warrant a post.

Only 7 years ago, I was exactly in this scenario and spent a ton of time obsessing over the
language to focus on. Back then, I didn't have the hindsight to know that eventually, if you
see a morsel of success in your career, language and tools are going to be the least of your
problems. But at the same time, when you don't know what you don't know, focusing on a
single language and even maybe a framework for a while is a good idea. It allows you to
avoid distractions and build the fundamentals.

It mostly doesn't matter. You need to pick a side and stick with it for a long time. How
long is a long time? Start with a decade and see how it goes from there. But there are ways
you can bet on technology that can give you a leg up. Instead of picking the hottest
language or fw, maybe look for tech that had a slow run for a long time and are still
relevant. Postgres, SQLite, and SQL in general. Mongo and Dynamo are also entering into this
zone of stability.
