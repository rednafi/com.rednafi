I enjoy writing about software—the books that I read, the things that I learn, and the work
that I do. Due to the constraints of the corporate software world, more often than not, you
can't directly showcase your work or talk about them. At least that's how it always has been
throughout my career so far. At the same time, as you grow older and start having a life
outside of your computer screen, you suddenly find that working on OSS after a 40+ hour
workweek is hard, and maintaining consistency is even harder. On that front, how do you keep
track of your progress or not lose your sense of purpose as the years go by?

I attempt to ameliorate this by factoring out the things I learn at or outside work and
writing about them in public. Countless times I've found myself looking for stuff on the
web only to land on my website. But this approach isn't bulletproof: you rarely come
across situations where you get to write about some novel concepts or one of your brilliant
epiphanies. Routinely, I find myself writing about just another tool or library that I've
figured out how to use or another book that's already considered a cliché in my area of
interest. Plus, there are probably a gazillion amount of more in-depth or clickbaity posts
that already exist on the topic. So what good it'll do if you add another drop to the ocean?
Who'll even read it?

The most recent example of this is when I spent an hour going through the [docs] of
`log/slog` package of Go 1.21 and another two listing out my most common [use cases]. I wrote
about it despite seeing countless examples of how to use it on the internet; some of them
even have the exact same title as mine. But I did that anyway because it helped me echo out
my own experience with the tool that I'll be able to relive in the future should the need
arise. The goal here was not to craft the perfect post for a curated group of audience to
get a bunch of SEO points. Rather I wanted to write it for myself to itch a very specific
scratch. If people find it useful, great, but if I find it useful in the future, even
better.

But every now and then I do experience those lightbulb moments that give birth to more
original proses like *[Avoide template pattern in Python]* that get well-applauded by the
venerable orange site dwellers. However, the general trend is that the majority of these
pieces go completely unnoticed. This might be one of them too and that's perfectly okay.
Internet applauds are great but that shouldn't propel your desire to explore and share your
thoughts on something. For me, the goal is to maintain a detailed progress log that can act
as my own [DaVinci's Notebook] and this post is another piece on the quiver. I love those
boring texts on well-trodden but useful topics as much as the viral ones!
