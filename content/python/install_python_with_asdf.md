I've just migrated from Ubuntu to macOS for work and am still in the process of setting up
the machine. I've been a lifelong Linux user and this is the first time I've picked up an OS
that's not just another flavor of Debian. Primarily, I work with Python, NodeJS, and a tiny
bit of Go. Previously, any time I had to install these language runtimes, I'd execute a
bespoke script that'd install:

-   Python via deadsnake[^1] ppa.
-   NodeJS via nvm[^2].
-   Go from the official binary source[^3].

Along with the hassle of having to manage three version managers, setting up multiple
versions of Python almost always felt like a chore. I've used pyenv[^4] before which kind of
feels like nvm and works quite well in practice. However, on Twitter, I came across this[^5]
reply by Adam Johnson which mentions that asdf[^6] can manage multiple runtimes of different
languagesâ€”one version manager to rule them all. Also, it's written in pure bash so there's
no external dependency required for the tool to work. Since I'm starting from scratch on a
new OS, I wanted to give this a tool to try. Spoiler alert, it works with zero drama. Here,
I'll quickly explain how to get up and running with multiple versions of Python and make
them work seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

For this to work, I'm assuming that you've got homebrew[^7] installed on your system.
Install asdf with the following command:

```sh
brew install asdf
```

Once asdf is installed, you'll need to install the Python plugin[^8]. Run this:

```sh
asdf plugin-add python
```

Also, you'll need to make sure that your system has these[^9] plugin-specific dependencies
in place.

## Bootstrapping Python

Once the prerequisites are fulfilled, you're ready to install the Python versions from the
source. Let's say you want to install Python 3.11. To do so, run:

```sh
asdf install python 3.11.0
```

This will install Python in the `/Users/$USER/.asdf/shims/python3.11` location. Just concat
the command to install multiple versions of Python:

```sh
asdf install 3.10.15 && asdf install 3.9.9
```

## Selecting a specific Python version

Once you've installed your desired Python versions with asdf, if you try to invoke global
Python with `python` or `python3` command, you'll encounter the following error:

```txt
No version is set for command python3
Consider adding one of the following versions in your config file at
python 3.8.15
python 3.11.0
python 3.10.8
```

To address this, you can run the next command to select the latest available version of
Python (here it's `3.11.0`) as the global default runtime:

```sh
asdf global python latest
```

Running this will add a `$HOME/.tool-versions` file with the following content:

```sh
python 3.11.0
```

You can also select other Python versions as the global runtime like this:

```sh
asdf global python <python-version>
```

In a project, if you want to use a specific Python version other than the global one, you
can run:

```sh
asdf local python <python-version>
```

This will add a `$PATH/.tool-versions` similar to the global file. Now you can just go ahead
and start using that specific version of Python. Running this command will create a virtual
environment using the locally specified Python runtime and start the interpreter inside
that:

```sh
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && python
```

## Removing a runtime

Running `asdf uninstall python <python-version>` will do the trick.
