This weekend, I was working on a fun project that required a fixed-time job scheduler to
run a `curl` command at a future timestamp. I was aiming to find the simplest solution
that could just get the job done. I've also been exploring Google [Bard][bard] recently
and wanted to see how it stacks up against other LLM tools like ChatGPT, BingChat, or
Anthropic's Claude in terms of resolving programming queries.

So, I asked Bard:

It introduced me to the UNIX `at` command that does exactly what I needed. Cron wouldn't
be a good fit for this particular use case, and I wasn't aware of the existence of `at`
before. So I started probing the model and wanted to document my findings for future
reference. Also, the final hacky solution that allowed me to schedule jobs remotely can
be found at the [tail][a-hacky-way-to-schedule-jobs-remotely] of this post.

## The insipid definition

The command `at` in UNIX is used to schedule one-time jobs or commands to be executed
at a specific time in the future. Internally, the system maintains
a queue that adds a new entry when a job is scheduled, and once it gets executed, the
job is removed from the queue.

> ***NOTE:***
    *By default, the jobs will be scheduled using the targeted machine's local
    timezone.*

## Prerequisites

The command isn't included in GNU coreutils, so you might have to install it
separately on your machine.

### Debian-ish

On a Debian-flavored Linux machine, run:

```sh
apt install at
```

Then check the status of `atd` daemon. This daemon executes the scheduled jobs.

```sh
service atd status
```

```txt
* atd is running
```

If the service isn't running, then you can start the daemon with this command:

```sh
service atd start
```

```txt
 * Starting deferred execution scheduler atd    [OK]
```

### MacOS

On MacOS, scheduled jobs are carried out by `atrun` and it's disabled by default. I had
to fiddle around quite a bit to make it work on my MacBook Pro running MacOS Ventura.
First, you'll need to launch the daemon with the following command:

```sh
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist
```

This will start the `atrun` daemon. Or enable it for future bootups by modifying
`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist` to have:


```txt
...
<key>Enabled</key>
...

```

On modern MacOS like Ventura, unfortunately, this requires disabling [SIP][sip]. Next,
you'll need to provide full disk access to `atrun`. To do so:

* Open Spotlight and type in *Allow full disk access*.
* On the left panel, click on *Allow applications to access all user files*.

![scr-allow-app-to-access-all-user-files][scr-a]

* On the right panel, add `/usr/libexec/atrun` to the list of allowed apps. Press
`cmd + shift + g` and type in the full path of `atrun`.

![scr-add-atrun-to-allow-disk-list][scr-b]

You can learn more about making `atrun` work on MacOS [here][atrun-disk-access].
Although I'm using MacOS for development, In my particular case, making `at` work on
MacOS wasn't the first priority because I deployed the final solution to an Ubuntu
container.

## A few examples

The following sections demonstrates some examples of scheduling commands to be executed
in a few different scenarios.

### Schedule at a specific time

To schedule a command to be executed at a specific time, use this command syntax:

```sh
at <time> <command>
```

For example, to schedule the command `ls -lah >> foo.txt` to be executed at `3:00 PM`
local time, you'd use the following command:

```sh
at 3pm
at> ls -lah >> foo.txt
at> <Ctrl-D>
```

Pressing `<Ctrl-D>` tells `at` that you have finished entering the command, and it
should schedule the job to run at the specified time. You'll see that at `3.00PM` local
time, a file named `foo.txt` containing the output of `ls -l` will be created.

### Schedule after a certain period of time

To schedule a command to run in a specific amount of time from now, use:

```sh
at now + <time> <command>
```

For example, to schedule `ps aux >> foo.txt` to run in 2 minutes from now, you'd use the
following command:

```sh
at now + 2 minutes
at> ps aux >> foo.txt
at> <Ctrl-D>
```

This will schedule the command to run in two minutes in the current local time.

### Schedule a script run

You can also run a script containing multiple commands at a specific time. To do this,
create a script file that houses the commands you want to run, and then use `at` to
schedule the script to be executed at the desired time.

For example, suppose you have a script file called `script.sh` that contains a `curl`
command which makes an API call and saves the output to a file. You can schedule it
as such:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

curl -X GET https://httpbin.org/get >> foo.json
```

```sh
at -f script.sh now + 1 minute
```

The script will be executed in a minute from now. You can check the content of
`foo.json` 1 minute later:

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.85.0",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-646162a8-71a232d563e0c16a4a497acf"
  },
  "origin": "74.140.2.169",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

### Schedule in a non-interactive manner

What if you don't want to create a new script file and also don't want to schedule a
command interactively as shown before? You can `echo` the desired command and pipe it to
`at` like this:

```sh
echo "dig +short rednafi.com >> foo.txt" | at now + 1 minute
```

We can also run multi-line commands in a single go by taking advantage of the heredoc
format:

```sh
at now + 1 minute <<EOF
dig +short rednafi.com >> foo.txt
EOF
```

In either case, 1 minute later, you'll see that a `foo.txt` file will be created in your
local directory with the following content:

```txt
185.199.111.153
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
```

This command above uses `at` to schedule the execution of a `dig` command for the domain
name `rednafi.com`. In this case, `dig` performs a DNS lookup, and the scheduled time is
set to be 1 minute from now in the current local time. The output of the command is then
appended to the file `foo.txt`. The `<<EOF` syntax is used for input redirection, which
allows the command to be specified in a heredoc format without requiring you to enter
the command in interactive mode as before.

### Schedule with UNIX timestamp

You can schedule jobs using a UNIX timestamp with the `-t` flag. The `at` command
requires a timestamp in the format `[[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]]`. Here's an example
that uses the `date` command to generate the current datetime, adds a 30-second offset
to it, formats it to the `at`'s expected format, and schedules a job.

On Linux, run:

```sh
at -t $(date -d "+30 seconds" +"%Y%m%d%H%M.%S") <<EOF
ping -c 5 rednafi.com >> foo.txt
EOF
```

On MacOS, run:

```sh
at -t $(date -v "+30S" +"%Y%m%d%H%M.%S") <<EOF
ping -c 5 rednafi.com >> foo.txt
EOF
```

### View and manage scheduled jobs

To view a list of scheduled jobs, use the following command:

```sh
atq
```

This will display a list of all the tasks that are currently scheduled.

```txt
36      Sun May 14 18:42:00 2023
37      Sun May 14 18:42:00 2023
```

To remove a scheduled task, use the following command:

```
atrm <job number>
```

The job number is the number assigned to the task when it was scheduled. You can find
the job number by running the `atq` command. If you need to clear all the pending jobs,
use this:

```sh
atrm $(atq | cut -f 1)
```

## A hacky way to schedule jobs remotely

This is a hacky and probably dangerous way to do remote job scheduling. However, the
beauty of side projects is that nobody's here to tell you what to do and it's a fun way
to play with hazmats.

I needed a way to quickly prop up a service that'd allow me to schedule webhook API
calls at a fixed point in time in the future. So I exposed a simple NodeJS server that'd
allow me to schedule an API call with `at` and execute the command at the desired
datetime. Here's the complete server:

```js
// server.js
import express, { json } from "express";
import { exec } from "child_process";

const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const authToken = "some-token";

app.use(json());

app.post("/run-command", (req, res) => {
  const { command } = req.body;

  if (!command) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Command not provided." });
  }

  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader || authHeader !== `Bearer ${authToken}`) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized." });
  }

  exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      return res
        .status(500)
        .json({ msg: "Command execution failed.", error: stderr });
    }
    res.json({ msg: "Command execution successful.", output: stdout });
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This endpoint takes in a shell command and just runs it on the server; bad idea, right?
But the endpoint is secured behind a Bearer token and I'm the only one who's going to
use this. Security by obscurity!

Before running the server, you'll need to install `express` and once you've done it,
you can start the server with the following command:

```sh
node server.js
```

Now, from a different console panel, you can schedule a remote task as follows:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer some-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"command\": \"echo \\\"ping -c 5 rednafi.com >> foo.txt\\\" | at now + 1 minute\"}" \
  http://localhost:3000/run-command
```

This will return:

```txt
{"msg":"Command execution successful.","output":""}
```

In my case, I needed to POST a payload at a certain time in the future:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer some-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"command\": \"echo \\\"curl -X POST https://webhook.site/d667acd3-477f-453c-9375-0dcbb51703bd -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -data '{"hello": "world"}'\\\" | at now + 1 minute\"}" \
  http://localhost:3000/run-command
```
