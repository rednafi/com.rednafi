TIL that returning a value from a function in bash doesn't do what I thought it
does. Whenever you call a function that's returning some value, instead of giving you
the value, bash sets the return value of the callee as the status code of the calling
command. Consider this example:


```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
# script.sh

return_42() {
    return 42
}

# Call the function and set the return value to a variable.
value=$return_42

# Print the return value.
echo $value
```

I was expecting this to print out `42` but instead it doesn't print anything to the
console. Turns out, a shell function doesn't return the value when it encounters the
`return` keyword. Rather, it stops the execution of the function and sets the status
code of the last command in the function as the value that the function returns.

To test it out, you can print out the status code of the last command when a script
exits with `echo $?`. Here's the same snippet from the previous section where the last
line is the command that calls the `return_42` function:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
# script.sh

return_42() {
    return 42
}

# Call the function.
return_42
```

Run the snippet and print the exit code of the last line of the script with the
following command:

```
./script.sh; echo $?
```

This prints out:

```
42
```

## Status code evaluation pattern

Here's one pattern that you can use whenever you need to return a value from a shell
function. In the following snippet, I'm evaluating whether a number provided by the user
is a prime or not and printing out a message accordingly:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
# script.sh

# Check whether a number is prime or not.
is_prime(){
    factor_count=$(factor $1 | wc -w)

    if [[ $factor_count -eq 2 ]]; then
        return 0 # Sets the status code to 0.
    else
        return 1 # Any non-zero value will work here.
    fi
}

# Call the function.
is_prime $1

# Inspect the status code.
status=$?

# Print message according to the status code.
if [[ $status -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "$1 is prime."
else
    echo "$1 is not prime."
fi
```

Since the returned values are treated as status codes where `0` is used to denote no
error and a non-zero value represents an error, you'll need to return `0` as a truthy
value and `1` as a falsy value. While this works, returning `0` to denote a truthy value
is the opposite of what you'd usually do in other programming languages and can confuse
someone who might not be familiar with shell quirks. If you only need to return a
boolean value from a function, here's a better pattern:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
# script.sh

# Check whether a number is prime or not.
is_prime(){
    factor_count=$(factor $1 | wc -w)

    if [[ $factor_count -eq 2 ]]; then
        true
    else
        false
    fi
}

# Call the function.
is_prime $1

# Inspect the status code.
status=$?

# Print message according to the status code.
if [[ $status -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "$1 is prime."
else
    echo "$1 is not prime."
fi
```

In this snippet, notice how the `is_prime` function doesn't explicitly return anything.
Instead, it just adds the `true` or `false` expression to the end of the return path
accordingly. This implicitly sets the status code to `0` when the input number is a
prime and to `1` when it's not. The rest of the status checking works the same as in the
previous script.

The second pattern won't work if you need to set the status code to something other than
`0` or `1`. In that case you can resort the first pattern without confusing anyone.
