Whenever I need to whip up a quick command line tool, my go-to is usually Python.
Python's CLI solutions tend to be more robust than their Shell counterparts. However,
dealing with its portability can sometimes be a hassle, especially when all you want is
to distribute a simple script. That's why while toying around with `argparse` to create
a dynamic menu, I decided to ask ChatGPT if there's a way to achieve the same using
native shell scripting. Delightfully, it introduced me to the dead-simple `select`
command that I probably should've known about years ago. But I guess better late than
never! Here's what I was trying to accomplish:

Print a menu that allows a user to choose an option and then trigger a specific
function associated with the chosen option. When you run the script, it should present
you with something similar to this:

```
1) Option 1
2) Option 2
3) Option 3
4) Quit
Please enter your choice: 1
You selected Option 1.
Please enter your choice: 2
You selected Option 2.
Please enter your choice: 3
You selected Option 3.
Please enter your choice: 4
```

Whenever the user selects an option, the script dispatches an associated function
with the option. Currently, the associated function just prints `You selected option x`
but it has the freedom to do whatever it wants. The following native Shell script
uses `select` to produce the output above:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# script.sh

# Define an array of menu options
options=("Option 1" "Option 2" "Option 3" "Quit")

# Function to handle Option 1
function option1 {
    echo "You selected Option 1."
    # Add your Option 1 code here
}

# Function to handle Option 2
function option2 {
    echo "You selected Option 2."
    # Add your Option 2 code here
}

# Function to handle Option 3
function option3 {
    echo "You selected Option 3."
    # Add your Option 3 code here
}

# Display the menu and process user selection
PS3="Please enter your choice: "
select option in "${options[@]}"; do
    case $option in
        "Option 1")
            option1
            ;;
        "Option 2")
            option2
            ;;
        "Option 3")
            option3
            ;;
        "Quit")
            break
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid option. Try again."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

The snippet allows users to make selections from a list of options. It starts by
defining an array called `options` which holds the available possibilities. Each option
corresponds to a specific function, such as `option1`, `option2`, and `option3` which
can be customized to perform specific actions or tasks.

The script then prompts the user to enter their choice using the `select` statement.
The user's selection is stored in the variable `option`. The script uses a case
statement to match the selected option and execute the corresponding function. For
example, if the user chooses `Option 1` by typing `1` into the console, the script calls
the `option1` function and displays a message confirming the selection. The same applies
to `Option 2` and `Option 3`. If the user selects `Quit` by typing `4`, the script
breaks out of the loop and terminates. If the user enters an invalid option, the script
displays an error message indicating that the option is not recognized and prompts the
user to try again.

Here's a little more useful script to run some common Docker commands based on the user's
selection. The script assumes that Docker engine is installed on the target system:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Define an array of menu options
options=(
"Show Docker Images"
"Remove Docker Image"
"Show Docker Containers"
"Remove Docker Container"
"Stop All Containers"
"Reprint Options"
"Quit"
)

# Function to show all Docker images
function show_docker_images {
    echo "Listing Docker images:"
    docker images
}

# Function to remove a Docker image
function remove_docker_image {
    read -p "Enter the image ID or name to remove: " image_id
    echo "Removing Docker image: $image_id"
    docker rmi "$image_id"
}

# Function to show all Docker containers
function show_docker_containers {
    echo "Listing Docker containers:"
    docker ps -a
}

# Function to remove a Docker container
function remove_docker_container {
    read -p "Enter the container ID or name to remove: " container_id
    echo "Removing Docker container: $container_id"
    docker rm "$container_id"
}

# Function to stop all Docker containers
function stop_all_containers {
    echo "Stopping all Docker containers:"
    docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
}

# Function to reprint the options
function reprint_options {
    echo "Available Options:"
    for index in "${!options[@]}"; do
        echo "$((index+1))) ${options[index]}"
    done
}

# Display the menu and process user selection
PS3="Please enter your choice: "
select option in "${options[@]}"; do
    case $option in
        "Show Docker Images")
            show_docker_images
            ;;
        "Remove Docker Image")
            remove_docker_image
            ;;
        "Show Docker Containers")
            show_docker_containers
            ;;
        "Remove Docker Container")
            remove_docker_container
            ;;
        "Stop All Containers")
            stop_all_containers
            ;;
        "Reprint Options")
            reprint_options
            ;;
        "Quit")
            break
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid option. Try again."
            ;;
    esac
done
```
