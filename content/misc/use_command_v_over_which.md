One thing that came to me as news is that the command `which` — which is the de-facto tool
to find the path of an executable — is not POSIX compliant. The recent Debian debacle[^1]
around `which` brought it to my attention. The POSIX-compliant way of finding an executable
program is `command -v`, which is usually built into most of the shells.

So, instead of doing this:

```sh
which python3.12
```

Do this:

```sh
command -v which python3.12
```
