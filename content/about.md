Ahoy, fellow daywalkers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also go by 'rednafi' on most platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix slingshotted me from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually landing me in brick-and-mortar software work.

I enjoy exploring system architecture, databases, data analysis, and API design. In my spare
time, I moonlight as a reader, writer, hiker, and a pathological minimalist.

## Work

I'm currently based in Berlin and working at [Wolt] as a software engineer. Before this, I
was exploring the healthtech industry in the US with [Dendisoftware] and the fintech segment
in Southeast Asia.

## Colophon

[Hugo] powers this blog. It's rocking the [Papermod] theme with some handrolled CSS flair. I
write in plain markdown and push the [content] to GitHub, triggering the [GitHub Actions] CI,
which then deploys the site to [GitHub Pages].

Learn more about the stack, deployment, and writing process [here].
