## Self

Hey there, fellow nightcrawlers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also known as "rednafi" on most
platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix zapped me to pivot from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually finding my footing in backend software development. I'm a [tinkerer],
[writer], and wanderer in the realm of designing and developing resilient software systems.

I enjoy working on system architecture, networking, data analysis, databases, and API
design. In my spare time, I'm an open-source contributor, a long-form content consumer, and
serve as an unapologetic critique of the overarching software landscape on this website,
[rednafi.com].
