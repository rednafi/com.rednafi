Ahoy, fellow daywalkers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also go by _"rednafi"_ on most platforms.

I'm currently based in Berlin and [working at Wolt] as a software engineer. Before this, I
was exploring healthtech in the US and fintech in Southeast Asia.

I focus on backend and distributed systems, mostly at the intersection of infrastructure,
databases, and observability. I deeply care about API ergonomics and contract stability,
especially when teams and services scale independently. I also help teams shape their data
architecture, plan for capacity, and keep observability signals flowing at scale. I like
working in the open and writing about my learnings.

Recurring themes: Go, Python, distributed systems, schema-driven development, eventual
consistency, resilience patterns, high availability, data access strategies, observability,
SRE practices, and sci-fi.


## Curriculum vitae

For the paper trail inclined, here's [my CV].

## Contact

The best way to reach me is via [email]. I usually check it in the morning and reply within
a day. Most of my work lives on [GitHub]. I used to be more involved in OSS, but these days
the day job takes up most of my energy, so that's slowed down. My Twitter account is gone,
and now I mostly rant on [Bluesky] and [Hacker News]. Every now and then, I cross-post a few
things on [LinkedIn] too.

## Colophon

[Hugo] powers this blog. It's rocking the [Papermod] theme with some handrolled CSS flair. I
write in plain Markdown and push the [content] to GitHub, triggering the [GitHub Actions]
CI, which then deploys the site to [GitHub Pages].

More on the [stack, deployment, and writing process] if you're curious.

## Breadcrumbs

- The handle _"rednafi"_ is just a portmanteau of my first name, _Redowan_, and my nickname
  _Nafi_, which my parents and a few close friends still use.
- I like sci-fis, and my all-time favourite book is _[Stanislaw Lem's Solaris]_.
- When I'm not banging my head on the keyboard, I'm probably out taking a long walk through
  some foresty area near a lake.
- I think through writing and not the other way around. Most of the blogs on this site take
  way longer to write than you'd think.

## Greatest hits

- [Oh my poor business logic]
- [The diminishing half-life of knowledge]
- [Annotating args and kwargs in Python]
- [An ode to the neo-grotesque web]
- [HTTP requests via /dev/tcp]
- [You probably don't need a DI framework]
- [Dotfiles stewardship for the indolent]
- [Configuring options in Go]
- [Recipes from Python SQLite docs]
- [Limit goroutines with buffered channels]
- [Pesky little scripts]
- [I kind of like rebasing]
