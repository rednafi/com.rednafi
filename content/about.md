## Self

Ahoy, fellow nightcrawlers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also known as "rednafi" on most platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix slingshotted me from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually leading to my osmosis into backend software development. I'm a
[tinkerer], [writer], and wanderer in the realm of designing and developing resilient
software systems.

I enjoy working on system architecture, networking, data analysis, and API design. In my
spare time, I'm an open-source contributor, a long-form content reader, and an obsessive
hiker who loves to rant about our increasingly techno-maximalist world.

## Work

Currently, I'm based in Berlin and working at [Wolt].

Prior to that, I was exploring the healthtech industry in the US at [Dendisoftware] and the
fintech sector in Bangladesh at [ShopUp].

## Tech stack

I prefer lean and stable tools that allow me to build things quickly without much theatrics.

Python, Go, Django, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB are among the subsets of
tools that I really enjoy working with.

For infrastructure, I like to take the least fancy routeâ€”setting up a VPC, configuring Nginx
and SSL with Ansible, and then publishing Dockerized services. But I'm also comfortable
working with GCP or AWS.
