## Self

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix zapped Redowan Delowar to pivot from electrical
engineering to data science, eventually finding his footing in backend software development.
He is a [tinkerer], [writer], and a wanderer in the realm of designing and developing
resilient software systems.

He focuses on system architecture, performance tuning, networking, data analysis, databases,
and API design. In his spare time, he is an open-source contributor, a long-form content
consumer, and serves as a clamorous pontificator of software lifecycle on his website,
[rednafi.com].
