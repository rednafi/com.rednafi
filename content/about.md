Ahoy, fellow daywalkers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also go by _"rednafi"_ on most platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix slingshotted me from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually landing me in brick-and-mortar software work.

I enjoy spending time mulling over distributed systems, databases, and API design. In my
spare time, I moonlight as a reader, writer, hiker, and a pathological minimalist.

## Work

I'm currently based in Berlin and [working at Wolt] as a software engineer. Before this, I
was exploring healthtech in the US and fintech in Southeast Asia.

## Curriculum vitae

For the paper trail inclined, here's [my CV].

## Contact

The best way to reach me is via [email]. I usually check it in the morning and reply within
a day. I do most of my work on [GitHub]. I used to be more active in OSS back in the day,
but my day job takes up most of my energy now so I'm less involved. I deleted my Twitter
account, and these days I mostly rant on [Bluesky] and [Hacker News]. I cross-post some
stuff on [LinkedIn] every now and then.

## Colophon

[Hugo] powers this blog. It's rocking the [Papermod] theme with some handrolled CSS flair. I
write in plain Markdown and push the [content] to GitHub, triggering the [GitHub Actions]
CI, which then deploys the site to [GitHub Pages].

More on the [stack, deployment, and writing process] if you're curious.

## Breadcrumbs

- The handle _"rednafi"_ is just a portmanteau of my first name, _Redowan_, and my nickname
  _Nafi_, which my parents and a few close friends still use.
- I like sci-fis, and my all-time favourite book is _[Stanislaw Lem's Solaris]_.
- When I'm not banging my head on the keyboard, I'm probably out taking a long walk through
  some foresty area near a lake.
- I think through writing and not the other way around. Most of the blogs on this site take
  way longer to write than you'd think.

## Greatest hits

- [Oh my poor business logic]
- [The diminishing half-life of knowledge]
- [Annotating args and kwargs in Python]
- [An ode to the neo-grotesque web]
- [HTTP requests via /dev/tcp]
- [You probably don't need a DI framework]
- [Dotfiles stewardship for the indolent]
- [Configuring options in Go]
- [Recipes from Python SQLite docs]
- [Limit goroutines with buffered channels]
- [Pesky little scripts]
- [I kind of like rebasing]
