## Ego

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix zapped Redowan Delowar to pivot from electrical
engineering to data science, eventually finding his footing in backend software development.
He is a [tinkerer], [writer], and a wandering autodidact with 5+ years of experience
designing and developing resilient software systems.

He specializes in system architecture, performance tuning, networking, data analysis,
databases, and API design. In his spare time, he is an open-source contributor, a long-form
content consumer, and serves as a vociferous pontificator of software systems on his
website, [rednafi.com].
