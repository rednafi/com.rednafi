## Self

Ahoy, fellow daywalkers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also known as 'rednafi' on most platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix slingshotted me from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually catalyzing my osmosis into brick and mortar software work.

I enjoy exploring system architecture, databases, data analysis, and API design. In my spare
time, I moonlight as a reader, writer, hiker, and a pathological minimalist.

## Work

Currently, I'm based in Berlin and working at [Wolt].

Prior to that, I was exploring the healthtech industry in the US at [Dendisoftware] and the
fintech sector in Bangladesh at [ShopUp].
