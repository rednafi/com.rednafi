Hi! I'm Redowan Delowar — also go by "rednafi" on the web.

I err on infra-leaning software work, but on occasion I've done and enjoyed product work
along the way. Generally, I skirt around distributed systems, databases, streaming
platforms, and observability work.

Recurring themes: Go, Python, distributed databases, eventual consistency, resilience
patterns, high availability, observability, SRE practices, and sci-fi.

## Curriculum vitae

For the paper trail inclined, here's [my CV].

## Contact

-   [Email]
-   [Bluesky]
-   [GitHub]
-   [LinkedIn]

## Colophon

[Hugo] powers this blog. It's rocking the [Papermod] theme with some handrolled CSS flair. I
write in plain Markdown and push the [content] to GitHub, triggering the [GitHub Actions]
CI, which then deploys the site to [GitHub Pages].

More on the [stack, deployment, and writing process] if you're curious.

## Breadcrumbs

-   The handle _"rednafi"_ is just a portmanteau of my first name, _Redowan_, and my
    nickname _Nafi_, which my parents and a few close friends still use.
-   I like sci-fis, and my all-time favourite book is _[Stanislaw Lem's Solaris]_.
-   I think through writing and not the other way around. Most of the blogs on this site
    take way longer to write than I'd like to admit.

## Greatest hits

-   [Oh my poor business logic]
-   [The diminishing half-life of knowledge]
-   [Annotating args and kwargs in Python]
-   [An ode to the neo-grotesque web]
-   [HTTP requests via /dev/tcp]
-   [You probably don't need a DI framework]
-   [Dotfiles stewardship for the indolent]
-   [Configuring options in Go]
-   [Recipes from Python SQLite docs]
-   [Limit goroutines with buffered channels]
-   [Pesky little scripts]
-   [I kind of like rebasing]
