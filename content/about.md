Ahoy, fellow daywalkers! I'm Redowan Delowar, also go by 'rednafi' on most platforms.

Circa 2018, a glitch in the matrix slingshotted me from electrical engineering to data
science, eventually landing me in brick-and-mortar software work.

I enjoy exploring system architecture, databases, data analysis, and API design. In my spare
time, I moonlight as a reader, writer, hiker, and a pathological minimalist.

## Work

I'm currently based in Berlin, working at [Wolt]. Before this, I was exploring the
healthtech industry in the US with [Dendisoftware] and the fintech segment in Southeast
Asia.

## Behind the blog

[Hugo] is the static site generator that powers this blog. I use the [Papermod] theme with
some custom CSS. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and served through a custom domain
registered from Cloudflare. The primary font is Inter, and the code examples use JetBrains
Mono.

GitHub Actions deploys the site automatically with each commit. Static assets are hosted via
GitHub Issues—yes, I know, it's lazy. I use VSCode to write in markdown and commit to the
repo. The CI takes care of everything else. You can find all the source code and content
[here].
